## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables
Ensure `.env.local` has:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 2. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel (or your platform)
```bash
# If using Vercel CLI
vercel --prod

# Or git push to trigger auto-deployment
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add Zerion-style Portfolio home"
git push origin new-features
```

### 4. Verify Deployment
- [ ] Visit production URL
- [ ] Connect wallet
- [ ] Check all portfolio metrics load
- [ ] Test vault deposit/withdraw
- [ ] Verify mobile layout
- [ ] Check historical graph

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Week 1
- [ ] Monitor for JavaScript errors (Sentry/similar)
- [ ] Check CoinGecko API rate limits
- [ ] User feedback collection
- [ ] Performance metrics (Core Web Vitals)

### Metrics to Watch
1. **Error Rate**: Should be <1%
2. **Price Fetch Success**: Should be >95%
3. **Page Load Time**: Target <2s
4. **Bounce Rate**: Track vs. old dashboard

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

### Quick Rollback (5 minutes)
1. Revert `app/page.tsx` to use old Dashboard:
   ```typescript
   import Dashboard from './components/Dashboard';
   export default function Home() {
     return <Dashboard />;
   }
   ```
2. Redeploy

### Gradual Migration (Alternative)
1. Keep Portfolio at `/portfolio` only
2. Old Dashboard at `/` (default)
3. Add banner to old dashboard: "Try our new Portfolio view"
4. Migrate users gradually based on feedback

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: CoinGecko Rate Limits
- **Symptom**: Prices show "â€”" or use fallback values
- **Impact**: Low - cached/fallback prices still shown
- **Workaround**: Users can refresh after 60s
- **Fix**: Upgrade to CoinGecko Pro API (future)

### Issue 2: Historical Data Takes Time
- **Symptom**: Graph shows "No historical data yet"
- **Impact**: Low - only affects new users
- **Workaround**: Data accumulates over time
- **Fix**: Subgraph integration (future enhancement)

### Issue 3: LocalStorage Limits
- **Symptom**: Very old historical data might be lost
- **Impact**: Very Low - only affects heavy users with months of data
- **Workaround**: Data auto-prunes to 30 days
- **Fix**: Move to backend storage (future)
